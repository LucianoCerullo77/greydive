## What it does?

This app consumes an JSON file.

## How it does?

The app makes a map of every object in the JSON file, showing in a Card the Client, URL Video, Task, Answer and Duration.

The hooks that i've used were useEffect and useState hooks, also I made 2 Custom Hooks called UseClient and UseClients, this hooks get the information of the JSON file and before that, using params, we interact with the app.
